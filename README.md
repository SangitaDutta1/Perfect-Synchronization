# Code for "Perfect Synchronization in Complex Networks with Higher Order Interactions" 
***
There are the following four files in this repository:

**final_integration**: This file contains the code for simulating a network system by changing the parameter values. The order parameter is calculated as a function of pairwise coupling $K_1$ (one can also vary triadic coupling $K_2$, and phase-lag $\alpha$). The parameter m (sigma) is varied to calculate the deviation $\rho$ from the synchronization.  

**Create_omega**: This file contains the function for creating the frequency.

**Create_Sys_kuramoto**: In this file the equations for the networked system is written explicitly. 

**ER_Adjacency.mat**: This is a Erd{\H{o}}s-R{\'e}nyi network of size 1000.
